                    <hr>
                    <p><i>By JAMES R. ELLIOTT | WASHINGTON BUREAU8-10 minutes</i></p>
                    <p><b>
                            WASHINGTON - President Johnson unveiled an ambitious $2 trillion climate change plan
                            yesterday that would transform the nation's energy infrastructure over the next decade,
                            calling
                            it "the most significant investment in our planet's future since the moon landing."
                        </b></p>
                    <p>
                        The proposal, dubbed the "Green New Horizon," would create millions of jobs while rapidly
                        accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources. Key components include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Complete decarbonization of the power grid by 2035</li>
                        <li>Tax incentives for electric vehicle adoption</li>
                        <li>Modernization of public transportation systems</li>
                        <li>Funding for climate resilience projects</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        "This isn't just about saving the planet for future generationsâ€”it's about creating good
                        jobs
                        right now for American workers," the President said during his Rose Garden announcement.
                        Republican leaders immediately criticized the plan as too expensive and government-heavy.
                        Senate Minority Leader Mark Richardson (R-KY) called it "a socialist wish list that will
                        cripple
                        our economy."
                    </p>
                    <h4>Local Impact</h4>
                    <p>
                        For New Yorkers, the plan would mean significant upgrades to subway infrastructure,
                        expanded bike lanes, and new job training programs in green energy sectors. Mayor Williams
                        hailed the proposal as "exactly what cities need to combat climate change while rebuilding
                        our middle class."
